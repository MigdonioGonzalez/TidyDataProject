# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Tidy Data Project - Codebook

The codebook here presented gives a brief description of the variables tidy_data1 and tidy_data2 generated by the run_analysis.R script. The variables and their description are enlisted below.

Description: The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING,WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz [1].

1. Subject: The identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. This variable goes from 1 to 30 as there were 30 test subjects.

2. Activity: Each activity the subject performed. This activities are listed below:
   * WALKING
   * WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
   * SITTING
   * STANDING
   * LAYING
3. Features variables: Listed below. Data coming from the accelerometer and gyroscope.

In all these variables mean() refers to the average and std() refers to the standard deviation. "Acc" stands for accelerometer and "Gyro" for gyroscope.  The variables with "Time" infront are time domain signals and "Freq" are frequency domain signals (treated with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) ).
